# Rename-all-files-in-Linux
This will rename all the files at once in Linux folder. (The files should be starting from the same name)

First of all, go to terminal and write:

sudo apt-get install mmv


After the setup go to folder where you want to change the file names usinf cd...

Write this command:

 mmv a\* b\#1



Note:
'a' is in the strating name of the file and 'b' is the name in which you want to convert your file.

That's all for today. Thank you :) Have a nice evening !
